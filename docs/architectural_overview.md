# TinyMLOps Architectural Overview

## Introduction

TinyMLOps is a framework designed to address the challenges of deploying and managing adaptive Machine Learning (ML) models on resource-constrained edge devices. The system consists of three main components:

1. **TinyLCM** (TinyML Lifecycle Management): Core library for on-device ML management
2. **Edge Device Applications**: Example implementations running on devices like Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
3. **TinySphere**: Server platform for centralized management and validation

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the TinyMLOps system, explaining how these components interact to enable autonomous and adaptive ML lifecycle management in resource-constrained environments.

## Design Philosophy

TinyMLOps is designed around several key principles:

1. **Edge Autonomy**: Edge devices should operate independently with minimal reliance on cloud connectivity
2. **Resource Efficiency**: All components must function within the constraints of low-power devices
3. **Drift Resilience**: The system must detect and adapt to data distribution shifts without ground truth
4. **Opportunistic Validation**: External validation should be used when available but not required
5. **Incremental Adaptation**: Models should evolve gradually as new data becomes available

## System Architecture

### 1. TinyLCM (Core Library)

TinyLCM is the foundation of the TinyMLOps ecosystem, providing the core functionality for on-device ML lifecycle management.

#### 1.1 Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline architecture in TinyLCM provides a structured approach to ML inference and adaptation:

- **InferencePipeline**: Base pipeline for non-adaptive inference with drift detection
  - Handles feature extraction, classification, monitoring, and drift detection
  - Provides a unified interface for processing input data
  - Manages operational monitoring and data logging
  - Designed for resource efficiency on edge devices

- **AdaptivePipeline**: Extended pipeline with adaptation capabilities
  - Inherits all functionality from InferencePipeline
  - Adds capabilities for model adaptation and state management
  - Integrates with QuarantineBuffer for storing samples with detected drift
  - Includes HeuristicAdapter for on-device pseudo-labeling
  - Provides different operational modes (monitoring-only, autonomous, server-assisted)

#### 1.2 Feature Processing

Feature processing in TinyLCM follows a two-stage approach:

- **Feature Extraction**:
  - TFLiteFeatureExtractor: Extracts high-dimensional feature vectors from raw input data
  - Leverages TensorFlow Lite for efficient inference on resource-constrained devices
  - Configurable to extract features from specific layers of the model

- **Feature Transformation**:
  - StandardScalerPCATransformer: Applies standardization and PCA dimensionality reduction
  - Reduces high-dimensional feature vectors to manageable size (e.g., 1280D â†’ 256D)
  - Improves efficiency of downstream tasks like KNN computation
  - Preserves essential information for drift detection

#### 1.3 Drift Detection

TinyLCM implements multiple autonomous drift detection strategies:

- **KNNDistanceMonitor**:
  - Monitors distances to nearest neighbors in feature space
  - Uses Page-Hinkley test to detect significant increases in distances
  - Particularly effective for detecting unknown objects or classes
  - Configurable thresholds and cooldown periods

- **FeatureMonitor**:
  - Tracks statistical properties of feature vectors
  - Detects changes in feature distribution
  - Uses control charts to identify out-of-distribution samples

- **PageHinkleyFeatureMonitor**:
  - Implements Page-Hinkley test on feature statistics
  - Efficient algorithm for detecting sustained changes in data distribution
  - Low memory footprint for resource-constrained devices

- **EWMAFeatureMonitor**:

- **Adaptive Handlers**:
  - ActiveHandler: Aggressively adapts to new labeled samples
  - PassiveHandler: Conservatively updates the model
