# 1. Introduction and Goals

## 1.1 Requirements Overview

TinyMLOps-PoC is a Proof of Concept for a lightweight Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) solution specifically designed for edge computing and resource-constrained devices.

The system addresses the following key requirements:

1. **Edge ML Lifecycle Management**
   - Versioning and tracking ML models on edge devices
   - Monitoring inference performance (latency, accuracy, resource usage)
   - Detecting data drift and model drift
   - Logging input data and predictions for analysis
   - Synchronizing with a central server

2. **Central Management Platform**
   - Collecting metrics and logs from multiple edge devices
   - Managing model deployments and versioning
   - Providing dashboards and visualizations
   - Integration with MLflow for experiment tracking
   - Creating a model deployment pipeline

3. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Operating on devices with limited memory (â‰¥512MB RAM)
   - Minimizing CPU usage and power consumption
   - Supporting various connectivity scenarios (frequent, intermittent, rare)

4. **Practical Demonstration**
   - The Mars Rover POC demonstrates TinyLCM running on a Raspberry Pi with camera support
   - Showcases practical application of edge ML lifecycle management

## 1.2 Quality Goals

| Priority | Quality Goal | Scenario |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | **Resource Efficiency** | TinyLCM must operate effectively on devices with as little as 128MB RAM and limited CPU. The ML management overhead should not exceed 20% of the actual model inference requirements. |
| 2 | **Reliability** | The system must preserve data integrity and model functionality even with unexpected power loss or connectivity issues. Operation should resume correctly after device restart. |
| 3 | **Adaptability** | New model formats or drift detection algorithms can be integrated without changing the core architecture. Custom components can be added through clearly defined interfaces. |
| 4 | **Security** | Model binaries and sensitive data must be protected from unauthorized access. Communication with TinySphere uses secure protocols with proper authentication. |
| 5 | **Usability** | Integration into existing ML applications requires minimal code changes. API should be intuitive for ML engineers with basic Python knowledge. |

## 1.3 Stakeholders

| Role/Name | Expectations |
|-----------|--------------|
| **ML Engineers** | Need clear interfaces to integrate their models with TinyLCM. Expect minimal overhead and transparent operation. |
| **Edge Device Developers** | Require efficient resource usage and compatibility with target hardware. Need clear documentation on integration patterns. |
| **MLOps Team** | Expect comprehensive monitoring data and centralized management capabilities through TinySphere. |
| **Data Scientists** | Need access to logged data for model improvement. Expect drift detection to provide actionable insights. |
| **Product Managers** | Require system to enable reliable ML-powered features on edge devices with minimal maintenance overhead. |
