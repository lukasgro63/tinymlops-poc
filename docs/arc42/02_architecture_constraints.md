# 2. Architecture Constraints

This section describes the constraints that limit our freedom in designing and implementing the TinyMLOps-PoC architecture. These constraints are boundaries that we must operate within and have significant influence on architectural decisions.

## 2.1 Technical Constraints

| Constraint | Description | Background and Reasoning |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Edge Device Limitations** | Must operate on devices with limited RAM (â‰¥128MB), CPU, and in some cases battery power. | The primary use case involves resource-constrained edge devices like Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. The architecture must be optimized for minimal resource consumption. |
| **Python Compatibility** | Must support Python 3.10+ while maintaining compatibility with older versions where necessary for edge devices. | Python is the primary language for ML development; newer versions offer important features but edge devices may have older versions. |
| **Network Constraints** | Must handle intermittent connectivity, low bandwidth, and high latency networks. | Edge devices may operate in environments with unreliable network connections or limited bandwidth. |
| **Storage Limitations** | Local storage on edge devices may be limited; efficient storage strategies required. | Edge devices typically have limited persistent storage capacity (e.g., SD cards with constrained write cycles). |
| **ML Framework Compatibility** | Must support common model formats (ONNX, TFLite, PyTorch) with minimal dependencies. | Different teams may use different ML frameworks; we need to support various model formats without bloating the edge component. |
| **Deployment Constraints** | No dependency on GPU or specialized ML hardware can be assumed. | Many edge deployments will not have access to accelerator hardware; we must support CPU-only inference. |

## 2.2 Organizational Constraints

| Constraint | Description | Background and Reasoning |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Open Source Ecosystem** | System should leverage and be compatible with popular open-source ML tools and formats. | Leveraging open-source components improves interoperability and reduces development effort. |
| **Documentation Requirements** | Must provide comprehensive documentation suitable for ML engineers with varying experience levels. | Clear documentation is essential for adoption and correct implementation. |
| **Version Compatibility** | Must maintain backward compatibility between TinyLCM versions and TinySphere. | Edge devices may not be updated as frequently as the central server, requiring compatibility across versions. |
| **Proof of Concept Scope** | Initial implementation is a PoC with limited scope; architecture must support future expansion. | As a PoC, we focus on demonstrating core capabilities while ensuring the architecture can scale for production use. |
| **Mars Rover Example** | Must include a functional Mars Rover PoC using Raspberry Pi with camera. | This serves as a concrete example implementation to validate the architecture and demonstrate capabilities. |

## 2.3 Conventions

| Convention | Description | Background and Reasoning |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Code Style** | Python code follows PEP 8 style guidelines. | Consistent code style improves readability and maintainability. |
| **API Design** | APIs follow a consistent pattern with clear naming conventions. | Consistent APIs are more intuitive and reduce the learning curve. |
| **Error Handling** | Comprehensive error hierarchy with meaningful error messages. | Clear error messages improve debuggability and user experience. |
| **Logging** | Structured logging with configurable verbosity levels. | Structured logs are easier to analyze and filter. |
| **Testing** | Unit tests for all components, with integration tests for key workflows. | Comprehensive testing ensures reliability and facilitates refactoring. |
| **Versioning** | Semantic versioning for both TinyLCM and TinySphere components. | Clear versioning helps manage dependencies and upgrades. |
| **Documentation** | Documentation follows arc42 template for architecture, includes API reference docs. | Standardized documentation improves comprehensibility and completeness. |
